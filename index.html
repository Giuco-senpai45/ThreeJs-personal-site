        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently a Computer Science student at Universitate Babes Bolyai
          in Cluj Napoca.
        </p>

        <p>
          This summer I discovered a passion for web development but I'm not
          certain yet what carrier path I'm going to choose in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lately I took an interest in the THREE JS library and I'm really eager
          to start doing some more advanced projects using 3D Modelling.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm really eager to become more proficient in the industry and be an
          active member in the development of future technological advancements.
